# simplepeft

This repository is a simple wrapper for Parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) in PyTorch.

The code is based on huggingface transformers, their peft library and pytorch-lightning.

The goal of this repository is to provide a simple and easy to use implementation of PEFT, with preconfigured models and easy to use training scripts.

At the moment there is no published package to install, but you can clone the repository and install it with pip install -e .
